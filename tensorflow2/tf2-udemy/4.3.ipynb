    "# \"Automatic\" Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "- W's and b's are randomly initialized, found iteratively using gradient descent\n",
    "- In the olden days of machine learning, feature engineering was at times the only way to apply ML successfully (see: computer vision)\n",
    "- Unfortunately this often requires domain knowledge\n",
    "- Eg. to build an image classifier for lÄ±ng cancer detection, you would have to be an expert in computer vision and looking at lung cancer images\n",
    "- To build a good stock predictor, be knowledgeable about finance\n",
    "- For a fraud detector, be knowledgeable about insurance industry\n",
    "- Deep learning allows people who are not domain experts to build models\n",
    "- Nowadays, non-radiologists can build state-of-the-art image classifiers for medical diagnosis"
